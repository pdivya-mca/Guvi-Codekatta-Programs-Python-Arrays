You are provided with an array. Your task is to print the count of subarray whose maximum element is strictly greater than ‘k’.

Input Description:
First line contains two element ‘N’ and ‘k’.Second line contains ‘n’ space separated numbers.

Output Description:
Print the count of subarray whose maximum element’s value is strictly greater than ‘k’.

 Input :
5 4
1 6 7 8 9
Sample Output :
14


n, k = map(int, input().split())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0

# Iterate through all the subarrays
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        sub_array = arr[i:j+1]
        if max(sub_array) > k:
            count += 1

print(count)
